# My_Work_Portfolio

## Description

This web page was created with the goal in mind of displaying my growing list of coding skills, as well as a plethora of completed projects to a future potential employer. It entails an about me section, links to all of my deployed applications and/or projects, and lists my contact details also.

Please not that, as I am still in fact learning the basics of web development there is currently not any projects on display as I have not built anything yet. This page should serve as a template for future reference and likely further modification. 

## Usage

A preview of the webpage as it is rendered in the browser, with an "about me" section, links to projects as well as contact details.

Link to the deployed application:
https://jlp-55.github.io/My_Work_Portfolio/
